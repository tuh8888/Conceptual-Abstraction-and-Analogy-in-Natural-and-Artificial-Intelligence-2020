* Questions and Topics
      - What are potential AI applications in which humanlike concept formation, abstraction, and analogy could improve performance and make systems more robust?
    - What is known in psychology and neuroscience about the mechanisms by which humans (and non-human animals) develop and use concepts, form abstractions, and make analogies?  How can such mechanisms inspire AI research?
    - Can gradient-descent-based systems learn to produce analogical reasoning on novel problems? What can the state-of-the-art in inductive program synthesis teach us about abstraction and reasoning?
     - How can abstraction and analogy-making abilities in AI systems be assessed?  What can we do to ensure that performance on a test will guarantee generalization?
    - Can we discover general computational mechanisms for abstraction and analogy by focusing on idealized microdomains, or could the real challenges lie in interfacing analogical mechanisms with a vast array of commonsense knowledge?
    - If we want machines to creatively invent wholly new theories from data, like scientists do, what roles would abstraction, analogy, and strong generalization play?

* Abstract

  # I present a method for inferring formerly represented pathway abstractions from sets of concrete pathways using an algorithm called Least Subsuming Subgraph (LeSS). A pathway abstraction (PA) is a schema for a set of pathways where constituent entities or activities are either left out or left unspecified. A PA may depict a submodule or subgraph in common among its subsumed concrete pathways (SCPs). Several PAs can be organized hierarchically, such as in the Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) ontology, but formal representations of these pathways depicting the structure and organization of entities and activities do not. PAs allow for modularization of known pathways, such as those in Reactome. Abstraction and modularization can assist in the transfer of knowledge from well understood pathways to new and less well understood pathways. Concrete pathway representations are often incomplete, and finding a good PA can facilitate hypothesis generation by making clear which entities or relationships need to be added, removed, or specified. In addition, pathway enrichment methods may not be able to map data to available target pathways because they either do not take into account causal directionality or require precise mappings to specific entities or activities. PAs can capture the underlying mechanism and allow for abstract matching of constituents. This method is evaluated by inferring PAs from Reactome and reclassifying the SCPs. A good PA will have lost only so much information from its SCPs as to be able to subsume all of them. The success of optimizing the PA information loss will be reflected on the recall and precision of the classification. A good PA will achieve high recall by losing information, thus subsuming more pathways, while it will achieve high precision by retaining information, thus subsuming only those pathways which actually are SCPs.
  # Biomedical research is largely focused around explaining the biological phenomena involved in human diseases and their interventions. These explanations often are in the form of biological mechanisms, a term used in more than 10% of PubMed abstracts in 2017 cite:dardenHarnessingFormalConcepts2018, which can be defined as the entities, activities, and organizational structures that produce regular changes from start to finish conditions cite:machamerThinkingMechanisms2000. Researchers often rely on analogies to explain mechanisms ("lock-and-key model of enzyme activity", "the heart is a pump", etc.) and these analogies can be helpful in forming hypotheses. It is believed that while humans frequently make low-level, within-domain analogies, they rarely make high-level or inter-domain analogies cite:gentnerComputationalModelsAnalogy2011, yet these are important when explaining mechanisms. If computational methods existed which could facilitate analogical reasoning, they would greatly improve mechanistic explanations of diseases and their interventions. Specifically, the construction of a hierarchy of mechanisms, each formally represented, which is structured so that general mechanisms are at the top and more concrete mechanisms are at the bottom, would help researchers to transition between mechanistic explanations at any level. Therefore, two broad goals are outlined in this proposal (1) to facilitate utilization of mechanistic knowledge about diseases and their interventions by constructing mechanism hierarchies built using a human-like automatic analogical reasoning strategy and (2) to promote the acquisition of causal knowledge about biomedical diseases from the biomedical literature through relation extraction which may improve (1).
   # Meanwhile, computational approaches of analogy have yet to be adopted for biological research, likely due to their reliance on hand-crafted rules cite:kuehneSEQLCategoryLearning2000 which are unsuitable to the diversity and complexity of biological areas of inquiry. However, if automatic approaches for analogy existed, they could be suitable for mechanistic inference, for which there is also very little computational infrastructure cite:dardenHarnessingFormalConcepts2018. Mechanisms are well-suited to schematization cite:craverSearchMechanismsDiscoveries2014, or abstraction, an unsolved task in computational analogy cite:gentnerComputationalModelsAnalogy2011. Automatic mechanism schematization of concrete disease mechanisms would allow researchers to construct general disease mechanism schemas which could be used to understand and translate knowledge between complex diseases.

   # Recent work by the Gene Ontology has focused on producing causal explanations of biological phenomena in the form of formal structural representations of mechanisms called Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMS) cite:thomasGeneOntologyCausal2019. These are often highly specific to a biological process and a model organism, so utilizing them for reasoning tasks outside of what they describe will require some method of generalization. Mechanism  schema have a number of purported uses including facilitating knowledge transfer, enhancing plausibility,
  # Here, I present a knowledge-driven automatic mechanism generalization method which takes specific structural representations of causal mechanisms and constructs a general structural representation of a mechanism schema which covers the specific mechanisms.
   # One of the main goals of biomedical research is to explain the biological phenomena involved in human diseases and interventions, yet computational methods stop short of providing human-like explanations. Understanding of these phenomena is often in terms of biological mechanisms which in turn are often understood in terms of analogies. Therefore the automatic generation of human-like explanations of biological phenomena will likely involve analogical reasoning. One kind of analogical reasoning, generalization, is related to an important task of reasoning about mechanisms called schematization. Mechanism schema can be used for the retrieval, mapping, adjustment, and evaluation of newly discovered and previously known mechanisms. Here, I present a method for the automatic schematization of biological mechanisms which uses both causal and non-causal knowledge about a set of structurally represented target mechanisms.
   # One of the main goals of biomedical research is to explain the biological phenomena involved in human diseases and their interventions, yet computational methods stop short of providing human-like explanations. Presented here is an automatic method based on analogical reasoning for generating causal schema to support the explanation of biological phenomena. The approach used offers the potential for systematic, scalable, and hierarchical mechanism schema construction which could be used for mechanism retrieval, identification, evaluation, and inference tasks.

   # The transmission and transference of ideas among the many domains of biomedical research can be difficult. It is diverse, with many areas of specialty each with there own names, jargon, questions, and interests. Though there is overlap among the processes and pathways which are relevant to each area of specialty, the context in which they are studied can vary by the organism, chemical perterbation, tissue type, genetic variant, or disease.

   # However, many of these specialty areas have in common the pursuit of mechanistic explanations. Often these are communicated using general analogies ("the heart is a pump", "the lock and key enzyme-substrate hypothesis", "unzipping DNA by heilcase") which can be effective both for understanding the underlying causal processes and inspiring new insights.

   # Analogies are efficient at elucidating ideas about mechanisms among researchers. This is because they can be used to relate domain specific causal processes to more widely understood causal processes. The analogies either implicitly or explicitly compare and align components of their subjects, allowing the domain specific knowledge to be abstracted away, leaving only the important causal information. These alignments can be formally represented as mechanism schema.

   # Mechanism schematization has a number of potential applications from retrieval and identification, to comparison and transformation, and even for causal inference.

   # The approach described here offers an automatic method for schematizing biological mechanisms using causal and non-causal knowledge. It is both systematic and scalable, which are necessary when dealing with the quantity and scope of available biomedical knowledge. The method takes formal representations of biological mechanisms and outputs their alignment as a formally represented mechanism schema. First, a novel algorithm for aligning and scoring chains of causal relations between sets of mechanisms is used and then the schema is constructed using sufficiently high scoring alignments. In the process of alignment, edges and nodes which are not shared are generalized by mapping to proxy edges and nodes. More distant proxy nodes are penalized in the scoring process. Then, causal distance is calculated between proxy nodes in the mechanism graphs.
   # Analogies in language usually involve implicit comparisons or alignments of their components, however automatic analogies may need to make these explicit. One of the tasks of analogies can be generalization to produce schema, which can be instantiated in multiple contexts. Analogical schematization is an appropriate strategy for biological mechanism schematization since biological mechanisms are often structurally represented and highly specific to a particular cellular process, enzymatic function, or organism. The method described here allows for mechanism schematization by aligning the mechanisms' causal pathways, scoring the alignments, then constructing a mechanism schema from abstracted components of the highly scoring alignments. To evaluate this method, these schema are compared to manually curated mechanisms.
   # Researchers in the biomedical domain often explain the biological mechanisms which underlie diseases and their interventions through the use of analogies. Presented here is an automated approach to help researchers explain biological phenomena through automatic schematization of causal mechanisms.

   # Human-like explanations are particularly important for establishing trust in predictions involved in clinical decision regarding drug interventions in cancer treatment. While AI systems provide great predictive power for scientific discovery and clinical decision making, they stop short of providing human-like explanations. Explanations for proposed cancer drugs are required to prevent off-target and adverse effects, avoid recurrence, and ensure effective treatment. Recently, there have been efforts to match FDA-approved drugs to cancer types, a process called drug-repurposing. While high-throughput assays allow for rapid testing of thousands of drugs, they are not able to predict the mechanism of action, the explanation of how the drug affects chemical pathways to restore healthy function or selectively kill tumor cells.

   The transmission and transference of ideas among the many domains of biomedical research can be difficult. It is diverse, with many areas of specialty each with there own names, jargon, questions, and interests. Though there is overlap among the processes and pathways which are relevant to each area of specialty, the context in which they are studied can vary by the organism, chemical perterbation, tissue type, genetic variant, or disease. Common among them, however, is the pursuit mechanistic understanding.

   # Systematic and scalable automatic means of schematizing causal knowledge across the many domains of biomedical expertise could improve researcher's abilities to explain their findings in a broader context and help find new discoveries.

   Analogical reasoning can be used to align causal mechanisms to produce human-like explanations in the form of mechanism schema. Analogies such as "the heart is a pump", "the lock and key enzyme-substrate hypothesis", and "unzipping DNA by helicase" are often used to communicate biological mechanisms because they relate domain specific knowledge with widely understood phenomena to elucidate the underlying causal pathways. Formal representations of alignments across related biological mechanisms could achieve the same effect. The method for producing such alignments is as follows.

   Domain specific causal knowledge of biological mechanisms which are formally represented are structurally aligned to produce formal representations of mechanism schema. The alignment of subject mechanisms uses both causal and non-causal knowledge, to score all possible causal relationships among the mechanisms. Sufficiently high scoring relationships are then used to construct the resulting mechanism schema. Entities and activities which are not shared among the mechanisms are resolved by identifying proxy nodes and their score is weight by the semantic distances between the proxy and its target. Chains of causal relations are generalized during the alignment as well.

   Initial results from this mechanism schematization strategy show that knowledge can be inferred across domain specific mechanisms. For example, the ability for the breast cancer drug tamoxifen to inhibit the growth of estrogen dependent breast cancer can be inferred by comparing a minimal subset of knowledge about breast cancer to knowledge about LHRH inhibitor's ability to inhibit testosterone dependent prostate cancer. Further evaluation will include hierarchical clustering of resulting mechanism schema constructed from REACTOME pathways to compare to the hierarchical characterization of biological processes found in the Gene Ontology's Biological Process hierarchy.

   Analogy schematization has a number of potential applications from retrieval and identification, to comparison and transformation, and even for causal inference. For a field such as biology, scalable and systematic methods to schematize mechanisms could improve the transfer of knowledge and improve explanations critical to improving the treatments of complex diseases.
