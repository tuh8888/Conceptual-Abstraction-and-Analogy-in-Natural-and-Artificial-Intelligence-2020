My name is Harrison Pielke-Lombardo and I want to start by saying thank you for coming this morning. Today, I'll be presenting my plan for completing my thesis work and the work I've already accomplished towards achieving that goal. Supervising me on this work is my advisor Larry Hunter as well as my thesis committee which is composed of Laura Saba, Jim Costello, Manuel Lladser, and Robin Dowell. Please, if you could hold your questions until the end. I'll try to leave time for them. Unless you're on my committee in which case please stop me if I've lost you. Afterward, there'll be time for the public to ask me questions and then you guys will leave for the private questioning session with just my committee. With that let's get started. My title for this work is "%t". Let's break that down. In this program, there is an emphasis on creating new computational methods to solve biological problems. So I will be presenting a few novel methods. Their goal will be schematizing biological mechanisms. I'll get to what I mean by mechanism in detail later. Schematization is the process of generalizing something. In this case, generalizing biological mechanisms. Scalable means that the methods will work on the kind of large, information-rich data and knowledge we find in biological problems. Systematic means these methods aren't just one-offs but part of a coherent set of tools. So this work is a set of computational tools for solving large, complex biological problems by generalizing the biological mechanisms we know about. Ok, so hopefully that gives you a basic overview. Next, to motivate this work, I'd like to tell you a story.</aside>

* Biological Mechanisms

  #+begin_quote
  Mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start or set-up conditions to finish or termination conditions.

* What is a mechanism schema?
  #+begin_quote
  A mechanism schema is a truncated abstract description of a mechanism
  that can be filled with more specific descriptions of component entities and
  activities.

* Goal
  Develop and evaluate an automatic mechanism schematization method using existing biomedical ontologies, databases, and knowledge-bases and use the schema to hypothesize new relationships and disease mechanisms.

  /Hypothesis/: Analogical alignment of concrete mechanisms will produce predictive and externally coherent mechanism schema.

** Starting materials
   - Input
     - Causal knowledge \rarr concrete mechanism graphs (REACTOME/GO-CAMs/MecCog) cite:fabregatReactomePathwayKnowledgebase2018,thomasGeneOntologyCausal2019,dardenHarnessingFormalConcepts2018
     - Other knowledge \rarr knowledge graph (KaBOB) cite:livingstonKaBOBOntologybasedSemantic2015
   - Output
     - Mechanism schema
   - Optimization
     - Maximize coverage of concrete mechanisms while minimizing information loss
     - Minimum common subgraph

** Algorithm overview

   Given a set of concrete mechanisms and a knowledge graph, find a mechanism schema.

   Step = causal relationship between two entities.

   1. Consider every possible step between two entities in the set of concrete mechanisms.
   2. Score each possible step.
   3. Assemble high scoring steps into the mechanism schema.


** Final step score equation

   \begin{equation}

   S_{GO}(A,B) = \frac
   {\sum_{t \in T_A \cap T_B} (S_A(t) + S_B(t))}
   {SV(A) + SV(B)}

   \end{equation}
   cite:wangNewMethodMeasure2007

   $$ C(a, b, m) = len(shortestpath(a, b, m)) $$

   $$ P(a, b, M) = \frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{m \in M} S_{GO}(a, a_m) S_{GO}(b, b_m) k^{-C(a_m, b_m, m)} $$
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Finally, we come to the equation which encompasses everything we discussed. As you can see, it takes the average of the relationship score over all specific mechanisms. The relationship score penalizes semantically dissimilar proxy entities and causally distant entities. Note that the causal distance calculation is between the proxy entities that we find. The scores for all possible relationships are calculated and high scoring relationships are assembled into the final mechanism abstraction.

** Future directions
   - Case study: oncogenesis via developmental pathways
   - Explore hyper-parameters:
     - score threshold
     - proxy-entity inclusion threshold
     - causal path distance weight
     - semantic similarity weights

** Algorithm
*** Scoring a step for each specific mechanism

    Is there an analogous step in this mechanism?

    1. Find proxy entities using semantic similarity \rarr analogous entities
    2. Causal path distance between proxy entities \rarr analogous activity or mechanism module

*** What are proxy entities?
    Step: tamoxifen \rarr testosterone

    What is an equivalent step between tamoxifen and testosterone in the prostate cancer mechanism?

    Warning: up next is a quite of bit of math which I am actually going to go over in detail because I need to show that it makes sense and that I understand how it works. For those of you who find it tedious, I'll give you this to think about. Assuming that what I've told you can get you from a set of concrete mechanisms to a general mechanism schema, what would convince you that it worked? Or that it was correct in some sense? Which of the virtues of mechanisms I gave earlier are most important to you? Logical coherence, generality, unification, testability, or hypothesis generation? Ok, here's some math.

  #    - Activities
  #    - Organization

  # ** Transfer of knowledge

** Use of mechanism schemas

  To my mind, this defeats the purpose of analogy-making, which is perhaps the only “zero-shot learning” mechanism in human cognition — that is, you adapt the knowledge you have about one situation to a new situation.
