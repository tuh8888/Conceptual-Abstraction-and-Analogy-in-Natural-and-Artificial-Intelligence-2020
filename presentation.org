My name is Harrison Pielke-Lombardo and I want to start by saying thank you for staying for my talk. I study computatinal biology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with my advisor Larry Hunter. Our lab's focus is in finding ways to leverage biomedical knowledge using AI to help understand biological phenomena. My title for my talk is a little verbose so I'm going to switch to a little bit more concise title inspired by one of the talks we heard earlier today. </aside>

  #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  I want to start by emphasizing the importance of analogies in helping biologists understand many biological phenomena. DNA replication starts with unzipping of the nucleotide bonds. There is a lock-and-key model for enzyme activity. Importantly, these analogies have helped make key predictions such as that there must be an analog to the zipper in DNA unzipping which is the enzyme helicase.

  Mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start or set-up conditions to finish or termination conditions.

 I use a definition of mechanism from Lindley Darden and Carl Craver's book  In Search of Mechanisms.

 This book is a great place to start for those interested in this kind of application of analogy to the study of biology.

  A mechanism schema is a truncated abstract description of a mechanism
  that can be filled with more specific descriptions of component entities and
  activities.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
However, what I am really interested in is the abstraction of mechanisms, which I'll refer to as mechanism schema. These allow for the transfer of causal knowledge across domains and many other uses. You can see here one of the key schemas used by biologists to explain how information contained in DNA is realized as functional proteins, referred to as the central dogma.

* How does biological mechanism schematization relate to computational analogy?

  - Tasks
    - Retrieval
    - Mapping
    - *_Abstraction/generalization_*
    - Rerepresentation

     #+BEGIN_NOTES
     If these are the tasks of computational analogy, then I think building mechanism schemas would lie in the abstraction or generalization task.

  Hormone-driven Cancer Schema
  #+REVEAL_HTML: </div>

 #+BEGIN_NOTES
 So what does mechanism schematization look like? Well, take two hormone-driven cancers: breast cancer and prostate cancer treatment mechanisms shown here in extremely simplified form. We can generalize over these to produce the schema on the right. Note that this was historically an important analogy for the discovery of the drug tamoxifen, the first targeted cancer therapy. By understanding prostate cancer treatment, researchers were able to explain the mechanism of action for tamoxifen.
 #+END_NOTES


* Goal
  Develop and evaluate an automatic mechanism schematization method using existing biomedical ontologies, databases, and knowledge-bases and use the schema to hypothesize new relationships and disease mechanisms.

  /Hypothesis/: Analogical alignment of concrete mechanisms will produce predictive and externally coherent mechanism schema.

** Starting materials
   - Input
     - Causal knowledge \rarr concrete mechanism graphs (REACTOME/GO-CAMs/MecCog) cite:fabregatReactomePathwayKnowledgebase2018,thomasGeneOntologyCausal2019,dardenHarnessingFormalConcepts2018
     - Other knowledge \rarr knowledge graph (KaBOB) cite:livingstonKaBOBOntologybasedSemantic2015
   - Output
     - Mechanism schema
   - Optimization
     - Maximize coverage of concrete mechanisms while minimizing information loss
     - Minimum common subgraph

** Algorithm overview

   Given a set of concrete mechanisms and a knowledge graph, find a mechanism schema.

   Step = causal relationship between two entities.

   1. Consider every possible step between two entities in the set of concrete mechanisms.
   2. Score each possible step.
   3. Assemble high scoring steps into the mechanism schema.


** Final step score equation

   \begin{equation}

   S_{GO}(A,B) = \frac
   {\sum_{t \in T_A \cap T_B} (S_A(t) + S_B(t))}
   {SV(A) + SV(B)}

   \end{equation}
   cite:wangNewMethodMeasure2007

   $$ C(a, b, m) = len(shortestpath(a, b, m)) $$

   $$ P(a, b, M) = \frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{m \in M} S_{GO}(a, a_m) S_{GO}(b, b_m) k^{-C(a_m, b_m, m)} $$
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Finally, we come to the equation which encompasses everything we discussed. As you can see, it takes the average of the relationship score over all specific mechanisms. The relationship score penalizes semantically dissimilar proxy entities and causally distant entities. Note that the causal distance calculation is between the proxy entities that we find. The scores for all possible relationships are calculated and high scoring relationships are assembled into the final mechanism abstraction.
   #+END_NOTES



** Future directions
   - Case study: oncogenesis via developmental pathways
   - Explore hyper-parameters:
     - score threshold
     - proxy-entity inclusion threshold
     - causal path distance weight
     - semantic similarity weights

** Algorithm
*** Scoring a step for each specific mechanism

    Is there an analogous step in this mechanism?

    1. Find proxy entities using semantic similarity \rarr analogous entities
    2. Causal path distance between proxy entities \rarr analogous activity or mechanism module

*** What are proxy entities?
    Step: tamoxifen \rarr testosterone

    What is an equivalent step between tamoxifen and testosterone in the prostate cancer mechanism?

    Warning: up next is a quite of bit of math which I am actually going to go over in detail because I need to show that it makes sense and that I understand how it works. For those of you who find it tedious, I'll give you this to think about. Assuming that what I've told you can get you from a set of concrete mechanisms to a general mechanism schema, what would convince you that it worked? Or that it was correct in some sense? Which of the virtues of mechanisms I gave earlier are most important to you? Logical coherence, generality, unification, testability, or hypothesis generation? Ok, here's some math.

   #    - Activities
   #    - Organization

   # ** Transfer of knowledge

** Use of mechanism schemas
   - Indexing/retrieval
   - Comparison
   - Transformation
   - Induction

** Role of statistics
   - Simulate generality by compiling lots of specific examples and averaging over them
   - Use knowledge to constrain statistical analysis

  To my mind, this defeats the purpose of analogy-making, which is perhaps the only “zero-shot learning” mechanism in human cognition — that is, you adapt the knowledge you have about one situation to a new situation.
